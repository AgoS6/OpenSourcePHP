# Koseu (코스)

Koseu solves a number of important use cases:

* A Next Generation Open Source Learning Management System
* A Learning Object Repository with seamless integration into previous-generation LMSs
* An independent open source, highly scalable, extremely flexible MOOC hosting platform

Eventually, this will be the best LMS, LOR, and MOOC hosting platform in the world.  But for now this is just a README file
so I can get started writing the code.

If you want to see Koseu in action visit these web sites:

* Python for Everybody www.py4e.com
* Web Applications for Everybody www.wa4e.com
* The Tsugi project - www.tsugi.org

Actually most of the koseu code that already exists lives in https://github.com/tsugiproject/tsugi - the Koseu
code will be refactored out of the Tsugi Management Console and into this repository.

# Technology

At this point it looks like Koseu will be written as a Silex (http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) application so it
has pretty URLs, routing, nice OO patterns and all that hipster stuff.

# What is in a name?

코스 is the Korean word for "Course" and www.koseu.com and www.koseu.org were still available :)
